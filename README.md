# The Georgia King Village Intervention
SQL with QGIS for Analysis of Incident Data Across Census Blocks


# Purpose

   To analyze a citywide GIS layer of incident crime in the years of 2004 through 2013 from a database file provided by the Newark Police Department, the spatial analysis software QGIS was programmed with SQL code to disaggregate the data by year and census block.


# Source Code Folder Files (SRC)

(a) *Incident_Query_Long_Version* - The inquiry contains the various street names associated with this block.

(b) *Incident_Query_Short_Version* - With the features of QGIS, a quicker approach was developed.

(c) *Incident_Query_by_Date_and_Time* - To eventually create a time series, diasggregating the data by time is available.

(d) *Query_of_Census_Shapefiles* - The analysis involved 2,541 blocks. The grid coordinates seem to have the range (-74.248724, 40.67644) to (-74.115949, 40.7877995). The specific block-level Federal Information Processing System (FIPS) code for Georgia King Village is 340130015001011. For this block, the respective parts of this FIPS code correspond to the following: State, 34; County FIPS Code, 013; Tract, 0015 or 15; and Block, 001011 or 1011. Incidentally, the Block Group is 1.


# Background

   While opening in 1976 as a place for middle class families escaping the public housing
developments post-1967 Newark riots, mismanagement and the introduction of crack cocaine initiated
a quarter-century of mayhem at this private apartment complex named after the founderâ€™s Mother and
Rev. Dr. King, Jr. In the early morning hours of July 1, 2009, three new guests arrived at this notorious
housing development of 1,000 people and soon after commenced a door-to-door survey. Six weeks
later, all shootings stopped and four months later the narcotics market moved completely off-site with
mentored addicts voluntarily asking for transportation to detoxification centers. In five subsequent
months, children were playing outside again due to the change in perception among Mothers about
safety thus reducing the risk of obesity, particularly for Black girls. Incidentally, LGBTIQ adolescents
were no longer harassed by gang affiliated peers.

   In an era of mass incarceration, this feat was accomplished with hardly any arrests and very
few evictions. Of the top quartile of violent blocks in that town, a regression discontinuity reveals how
this neighborhood experienced the most statistically significant decrease in crime. Over eight months
the change was 87 percent, or 15 incidents per month in August 2009 to 2 per month in March 2010.
The attractor state of social determinants shifted as a result of interventions in interpersonal networks.
